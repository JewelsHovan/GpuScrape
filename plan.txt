1. Newegg/Bestbuy -> offers best prices and reliable shipping

2. Limitations -> scrape for price or availablility -> probably implement a both -> if its available and price (price can be 1.x of MSP that we can deem)

3. Do you want to enter our card info -> harder to implement and we really don't want bot mass buying -> probably better to just give a notification but also give a link so we can access it fast

4. Language -> python selenium -> an ok choice -> however takes more memory with a browser, however button interactions is easier -> the sites might have protection against selenium bots however -> its good choice since could run it on second pc.

- Javascript least experience but could be strongest for this -> need to learn more definitely
